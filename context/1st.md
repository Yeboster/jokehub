Hello! We are working on the "Joke Hub" application.

Please familiarize yourself with the project by:
1.  Reading the project history and current state from `context/PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`.
2.  Reviewing the project progress in `context/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
3.  Understanding how to use these context files by reading `context/PROJECT_CONTEXT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

The application is built with Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, Genkit (for AI), and Firebase.

Once you've processed this information, please confirm your understanding, and we can continue development.
